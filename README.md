# PIC16 Tetris

This is an embedded Tetris clone written in C to run on a PIC16F884 device.
It uses four simple buttons and an LCD display,
in particular MikroE's https://www.mikroe.com/glcd-128x64, although
another LCD module could probably also be made to work.

All the schematic files and a PCB file are in the `scheme` directory.
They were made using KiCad.
